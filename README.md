# Maslow Firmware
====
This is the firmware for the Maslow CNC Router modified for stepper motor support.

## Steps to setup the Firmware development environment

First clone the Firmware repository, then install and setup the IDE of your choice.

### Using Arduino IDE
1. Download [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) 1.8.1 or higher
2. Install Arduino IDE and run Arduino IDE
3. Navigate menus: File, Open
4. In the file chooser navigate to the cloned repository and choose the "cnc_ctrl_v1.ino" file to open
5. Navigate menu: Tools, Board, change to "Arduino/Genuino Mega or Mega 2560"
6. Navigate menu: Sketch -> Upload

This should compile the project without errors, and possibly some warnings.

### Using PlatformIO
1. Download package for [Atom](https://atom.io/)
2. Follow directions for [installing PlatformIO within Atom](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide/atom.html#ide-installation)
3. Within Atom navigate menus: PlatformIO, Open Project Folder...
4. Select "Firmware" directory
5. Select menu: PlatformIO, Initialize or Update PlatformIO Project
6. Select Board: Adruino Mega or Mega 2560 ATmega2560 (Mega 2560)
7. Click the "Process" button, this creates a platformio.ini file with PlatformIO settings
8. Edit the platformio.ini file by adding these lines:
 
    > [platformio]

    > src_dir = cnc_ctrl_v1

9. Save the platformio.ini, wait for Atom to reload the project automatically
10. Select menu: PlatformIO, Build

The reason for the editing of the platformio.ini is because the default location for code files is a "src" directory. To override this default and stay compatible with the Arduino IDE this fix must be made.

### Using Eclipse Neon C/C++ with Sloeber plugin

TODO: Not ready for consumption yet, creating a new sketch creates a default ino file, and does not appear to use the imported folder's, need to figure out how to use the Firmware's ino file, and not the default. Leaving these steps as most will not change.

1. Download [Eclipse C/C++](https://eclipse.org/downloads/) Neon or higher
2. Install Eclipse C/C++ and run Eclipse
3. Install Sloeber Arduino plugin
   * Navigate menus: Help, Install New Software...
   * Copy this URL in the "Work With" field: http://eclipse.baeyens.it/update/V4/stable
   * Select "Add" button
   * Select "Sloeber Arduino IDE" check box
   * Select "Finish" button
   * Accept defaults and accept licenses, the plugin will restart Eclipse, and configure the plugin
4. Change to Arduino perspective, navigate menus: Window, Perspective, Open Perspective, Other...
   * Choose the "Arduino" perspective and select "Ok" button
5. Create an Arduino project
   * Navigate menus: File, New, New Arduino Sketch
   * Project Name: cnc_ctrl_v1
   * Select "Next" button
   * Select appropriate item from "Platform folder" drop down listing
   * Select Board: Arduino/Genuino Mega or Mega 2560
   * Select Upload Protocol: Default
   * Select Processor: ATmega2560 (Mega 2560)
   * Select "Finish" button
   * Select project folder, navigate menus: File, Import...
   * Expand "Arduino" and select "Import a folder containing source code in the current project"
   * Select "Next" button
   * Select the "Browse" button to select the source location (location of the cloned repository cnc_ctrl_v1 directory)
   * Select "Finish" button
   
### Using NotePad++ in Conjunction with the Arduino IDE
1. Download NotePad++ (Windows only) [link](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
2. Download the Arduino IDE          [link](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)
3. Set that you would like use an external editor from within the Arduino IDE by clicking File -> Preferences -> Use External Editor
   *The Arduino editor will no longer allow you to edit the files, but instead will only work to compile and upload your code. 
   *The code can be edited from within NotePad++
   *This method can be used on other platforms with editing programs other than NP++
